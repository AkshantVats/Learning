  # Problems

  1. Given an array of numbers, replace each even number with two of the same number. e.g, [1,2,5,6,8, , , ,] -> [1,2,2,5,6,6,8,8].Assume that the array has the exact amount of space to accommodate the result.

  2. Given an array of numbers, move each zero number at the end of the array. e.g, [1,0,5,0,8] -> [1,5,8,0,0].

  3. Given a sentence, reverse the words of the sentence.For example,"i live in a house" becomes "house a in live i".

  4. Given an array, reverse the order of its elements.For example, [3,5,2,5,2,3,9] â†’ [9,3,2,5,2,5,3]

  5. 2 Sum Problem: Given a sorted array of integers, find two numbers in the array that sum to a given integer target.For example, if a = [1,2,3,5,6,7] and target = 11, the answer will be 5 and 6.

  6. Given a sorted array in non-decreasing order, return an array of squares of each number, also in non-decreasing order. For example:[-4,-2,-1,0,3,5] -> [0,1,4,9,16,25]
